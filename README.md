We are @escritorio-curitiba, the staff missionaries of the Brazil Curitiba Mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

This repository is for storing all of our code projects written for the benefit of the mission and the hastening of the Lord's work.

Most of it was written by Elder Loertscher.
